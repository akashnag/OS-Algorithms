Contributing to Data-Structures
===============================

Thank You for considering to contribute to this project! Please read this document carefully before doing any of the following:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

Python implementations of more common data structures not yet part of this repository are most welcome!

## Proposing changes/new features, Submitting a fix

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/akashnag/Data-Structures/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue. But before you do so, make sure the issue has not been reported/solved earlier. Please be as clear and concise as possible when reporting bugs.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Please ensure all your code is properly indented and spaced as all existing code in this repository. Also ensure you include a simple test function along with your implementation of the data structure.
